# Flight PHP Skeleton App

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Flight PHP application. This application uses the latest version of Flight PHP v3.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. You also could download a zip of this repo, downloading a zip of the [flightphp/core](https://github.com/flightphp/core) repo, and manually autoload the files by running `require('flight/autoload.php')` in your `app/config/bootstrap.php` file.

## Installation

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Flight PHP application. (this will require PHP 7.4 or newer)

```bash
composer create-project flightphp/skeleton Dolibar_API
